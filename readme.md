This project showcases a simple full-stack application using React for the front end and Node.js with TypeScript for the backend. The backend uses Express and simulates DynamoDB operations, and the communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated by Axios. The UI components are built using Ant Design.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with a clear organization for both frontend and backend:

  - backend/`**: Node.js with TypeScript backend.
    - controllers/`**: Controllers for handling HTTP requests.
    - models/`**: Interfaces defining the data structures.
    - repositories/`**: Simulated DynamoDB operations.
    - routes/`**: Define routes for different functionalities.
    - services/`**: Business logic for different features.
  - frontend/`**: React with TypeScript frontend.
    - components/`**: React components for different parts of the UI.
